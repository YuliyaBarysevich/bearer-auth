1. **As a user, I want to create a new account so that I may later login**
    - Using a tool such as `httpie`, `postman`, or a web form:
    - Make a **POST** request to the `/signup` route with **username** and **password**
    - Your server should support both JSON and FORM data as input
    - On a successful account creation, return a 201 status with the user object in the body
    - On any error, trigger your error handler with an appropriate error
